# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2024-01-15

## Codebase Patterns
- Commit format: `feat: [US-XXX] - Title`
- Branch name: main
- localStorage keys: mh_cart, mh_promo, mh_orders
- CSS files: main.css (core/variables), components.css, pages.css
- JS files: main.js (core), products.js, cart.js, filters.js, checkout.js
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings), Inter (body)
- Colors: Burgundy #722F37, Gold #D4A844, Cream #FDF5E6, Charcoal #2D2D2D, Off-white #FAFAFA

## Key Files
- index.html - Landing page
- /pages/*.html - All other pages
- /css/*.css - Stylesheets
- /js/*.js - JavaScript modules
- /data/products.json - Product data
- /images/placeholders/ - Placeholder images

- Placeholder colors by category: Burgundy (Precision Shapers), Gold (Fun-cessories), Charcoal (Support), Midnight Blue (Night Guards)
- SVG is better than PNG for placeholders: smaller file size, scales perfectly, text stays crisp

## 2026-01-16 - US-015

- What was implemented:
  - Created `pages/checkout.html` with contact/shipping form, empty state, and order summary
  - Added checkout page styles for layout, form sections, and summary card
  - Implemented checkout page logic in `js/main.js` for rendering, validation, and order processing
- Files changed:
  - pages/checkout.html (new)
  - css/pages.css
  - js/main.js
  - tasks.json
- **Learnings:**
  - Checkout form can reuse CheckoutModule field validators without collecting payment data
  - Disabling submit until required fields validate keeps the UX calm and deliberate
  - Cart image paths need normalization when rendering from /pages/

## 2026-01-16 - US-001

- What was implemented:
  - Created folder structure: /pages, /css, /js, /images/placeholders, /data
  - Created index.html with HTML5 boilerplate, font imports, CSS/JS links
  - Created netlify.toml with publish config and security headers
  - Initialized git repository on main branch
  - Created .gitignore for common development files
  - Added placeholder CSS and JS files so index.html loads properly
- Files changed:

## 2026-01-16 - US-003

- What was implemented:
  - Created /data/products.json with complete product catalog (12 products)
  - 4 categories with 3 products each: Precision Shapers, Croc-Style Fun-cessories, Support & Lift Systems, Night Guards & Sleepwear
  - Each product includes all required fields: id, name, category, description, price, images (array), sizes (array), colors (array), reviews (array with 3 reviews each), rating, reviewCount, inStock, stockCount, isNew, salesCount, dateAdded
  - Deadpan serious descriptions treating absurd products as legitimate (e.g., "laboratory-grade precision", "patented tri-axis adjustment system", "Mustache Isolation Chamber")
  - 36 fake reviews total with realistic names, varied ratings (4-5 stars), and earnest commentary
  - One product (SleepSecure Mustache Bonnet) marked as out of stock for testing
  - 3 products marked as isNew: true for "newest" sorting tests
- Files changed:
  - data/products.json (new - 491 lines)
- **Learnings:**
  - Product IDs should be kebab-case slugs derived from product names for URL friendliness
  - Reviews need consistent date format (ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD) for sorting
  - Having one out-of-stock item is useful for testing inventory display logic
  - salesCount values should be varied enough to test "best sellers" sorting
  - Category names must exactly match what filters will use

## 2026-01-16 - US-002

- What was implemented:
  - Complete CSS custom properties system with brand colors, typography, spacing, shadows, transitions
  - CSS reset/normalize for consistent cross-browser baseline
  - Base typography styles for all heading levels (h1-h6) and body text
  - Extensive utility classes: flexbox, grid, spacing (margin/padding), text alignment, colors, display, positioning
  - Button component styles: primary, secondary, outline, outline-secondary, ghost variants + sizes (sm, lg, xl, block)
  - Form input styles: inputs, selects, textareas, checkboxes, radios, validation states (valid/invalid), helper text
  - Card component base styles with variants (bordered, interactive)
  - Responsive breakpoints for tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px)
- Files changed:
  - css/main.css (fully implemented - ~970 lines)
- **Learnings:**
  - CSS custom properties allow easy theme consistency throughout the project
  - Using a spacing scale (--space-1 through --space-24) keeps spacing consistent
  - Form focus states should use box-shadow for the focus ring to avoid affecting layout
  - Button :active states benefit from subtle translateY for tactile feedback
  - Card hover effects work well with box-shadow transitions rather than scale transforms

  - Updated products.json to reference .svg files instead of .jpg
- Files changed:
  - 31 new SVG files in images/placeholders/

  - SVG placeholders are ideal: vector-based, infinitely scalable, small file size
  - Using XML entities (&amp;) for special characters in SVG text elements
  - Vary background shades slightly for different "angles" to visually distinguish multiple images
  - The replace_all option in Edit is efficient for batch find-replace operations

- **Learnings:**
  - Cache loaded products to avoid repeated fetch calls
  - Use window.ProductsModule pattern for vanilla JS module exports (no bundler)
  - Sort functions should return new arrays to avoid mutating original data
  - "Featured" sort can combine salesCount and rating with weighted formula
  - Size sorting needs custom order (S, M, L, XL, One Size) rather than alphabetical
  - Intl.NumberFormat is the cleanest way to format currency

  - Promo codes should be normalized (uppercase, trimmed) before validation and storage
  - generateCartId() uses timestamp + random string for uniqueness without requiring a DB
  - Keep promo code definitions in a constant object for easy addition of future codes
  - updateQuantity(cartId, 0) should remove the item rather than keeping quantity 0

  - Added filters.js script tag to index.html
- Files changed:
  - js/filters.js (new - 392 lines)
  - index.html (added script tag)
- **Learnings:**
  - URLSearchParams API simplifies query string parsing and building
  - pushState vs replaceState: push creates history entry, replace doesn't
  - Comma-separated values work well for multi-select filters in URLs (categories=A,B,C)
  - popstate event fires on browser back/forward, not on pushState/replaceState
  - Filter modules should depend on ProductsModule but not require it to load
  - hasActiveFilters should not count sort as an "active filter" for clear filter UX

- **Learnings:**
  - Sticky header needs z-index from CSS variables (--z-sticky) for proper layering
  - Mobile menu toggle uses aria-expanded attribute for accessibility and CSS styling
  - Cart badge should hide when count is 0 using CSS attribute selector [data-count="0"]
  - IIFE pattern ((function(){})()) keeps module variables private while exposing API via window
  - Custom events (document.dispatchEvent) allow loose coupling between cart and header

## 2026-01-16 - Debug Session: Products Not Loading

- **Issue:** Shop page showed "No products found" even though products.json existed
- **Root causes found (4 bugs):**
  1. **netlify.toml catch-all redirect** - The `/* -> /index.html` redirect intercepted ALL requests including `/data/products.json`, returning HTML instead of JSON. Fix: Add explicit redirects for static asset paths (`/data/*`, `/js/*`, `/css/*`, `/images/*`, `/pages/*`) before any catch-all.
  2. **Clean URL page detection** - `bunx serve` and Netlify serve `/pages/shop` without `.html` extension, but code checked `path.includes('shop.html')` which failed. Fix: Added helper function `isPage(name)` that checks both with and without `.html`.
  3. **Price filter null vs undefined** - Filter used `filters.minPrice !== undefined` but parseFiltersFromURL returns `null` for empty values. `null !== undefined` is TRUE, so it tried `price >= null` which fails. Fix: Changed to `!= null` which handles both null and undefined.
  4. **CSS overriding hidden attribute** - `.shop-empty { display: flex }` overrides the HTML `hidden` attribute. Fix: Added `.shop-empty[hidden] { display: none; }` to respect the attribute.
- **Files changed:**
  - netlify.toml (static asset redirect rules)
  - js/main.js (clean URL support in initCurrentPage)
  - js/products.js (price filter null handling)
  - css/pages.css (hidden attribute respect)
- **Debugging approach:**
  - Used Chrome DevTools via MCP to inspect console errors and network requests
  - Manually called `loadProducts()` and `filterProducts()` in console to isolate the issue
  - Checked `window.location.pathname` to discover clean URL difference
  - Used `getComputedStyle()` to find CSS override of hidden attribute
- **Learnings:**
  - Netlify catch-all redirects (`/*`) will intercept static file requests - always add exceptions for asset directories
  - When supporting clean URLs, page detection should check multiple path formats (with/without extension, with/without trailing slash)
  - JavaScript `!== undefined` does NOT catch `null` - use `!= null` (loose equality) to check for both
  - CSS `display` property always overrides HTML `hidden` attribute - need explicit `[hidden] { display: none }` rule
  - `bunx serve` strips `.html` extensions by default - local dev may differ from production URL structure
  - Browser console + network tab are essential for debugging fetch failures

  - Confirmation page needs three states: loading, error (order not found), and success (order details)
  - getCountryName() helper maps country codes to readable names for address display
  - Image paths from order items need '../' prefix normalization when in /pages/ directory
